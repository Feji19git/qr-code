## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Major area I learnt was in CSS 

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I Would love to continue learning the various way to style using CSS and other languages that support for styling the web and would love to advance to javascript soon.


### Useful resources
